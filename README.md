# Celebrating NFTEarth on zkSync Era 

As NFTEarth begins its Omnichain strategy to become the world's hub of NFT activity, we wanted to take a moment to celebrate with an EarthPass Edition Mint - not only celebratory - the EarthPass comes with a form of shared Allowlist utility for all other NFT creators to use as they launch their NFT collections!

The token will be available for minting ONLY for a brief window of time.

The EarthPass Minting Site Preview: Providing our community with an opportunity to interact with zkSync and increase the chance of receiving an airdrop has been requested multiple times, here the team is delivering on that request.
