# Celebrating NFTEarth on zkSync Era 

As NFTEarth begins its Omnichain strategy to become the world's hub of NFT activity, we wanted to take a moment to celebrate with an EarthPass Edition Mint - not only celebratory - the EarthPass comes with a form of shared Allowlist utility for all other NFT creators to use as they launch their NFT collections!

The token will be available for minting ONLY for a brief window of time.
